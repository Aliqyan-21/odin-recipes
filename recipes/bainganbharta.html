	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 large eggplant</li>
		<li>4 tbsp oil</li>
		<li>2 chopped medium sized onions </li>
		<li>2 chopped medium sized tomatoes</li>
		<li>3 garlic cloves</li>
		<li>3 green chilies</li>
		<li>1 tsp garam masala powder</li>
		<li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
		<li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
		<li>1 tomato</li>
		<li>1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander</li>
		<li>salt as per taste</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps To Make</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>First, wash the eggplant and make small slits all over using a fork. This is done to help steam escape and the eggplant to cook evenly.</li>

		<li>Now place the eggplant directly onto the gas flame and cook on medium to high heat. Rotate it frequently so that it cooks evenly on all sides. Cook it until the skin forms blisters and the eggplant turns soft. This might take around 10-15 minutes.</li>
		
		<li>Once the eggplant is cooked, remove it from the flame and place it in a dish. Cover it with a lid and let it cool down for around 10 minutes.</li>
		
		<li>Next, remove the charred skin from the eggplant using a knife lightly. You can also use your hands to remove it. Mash the eggplant thoroughly using a spoon or fork.</li>
		
		<li>Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them crackle. Add finely chopped onions and saut√© them for 2-3 minutes until they turn golden brown.</li>

		<li>Now add minced garlic cloves, chopped tomatoes, green chilies, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and garam masala powder. Mix everything well and saute for another 2-3 minutes until the tomatoes become soft and mushy.</li>

		<li>Add mashed eggplant into the pan and mix everything well. Cook it for 5 minutes on low to medium flame.</li>

		<li>Finally, add salt to taste and garnish with chopped coriander leaves. And it's ready to serve.</li>
